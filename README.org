* Let's be honest: the moon is pretty dope.
Here's a script which writes the current phase of the moon (in emoji form)
to stdout. I use it in my shell prompt, which I highly recommend per the first sentence of this
paragraph.

* to use it
The easiest way is to call the self-contained interpreted script, ~moon-phase~. I'd recommend
symlinking it somewhere in your ~$PATH~, but you do you. The code is identical to =moon.el=, which is
provided as an easier entry point in case you want to use/edit it with your own emacs instance on
your own terms. Go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit.

The ~moon-phase-fast~ wrapper script directly calls the byte-compiled version of the elisp file, which
I added to the repo. I don't know how portable elisp bytecode is, though: it's possible you'll have
to crack open an emacs instance of your own and run ~byte-recompile-file~ on =moon.el=.

* where the astronomical calculations came from
This uses functions adapted from the =lunar.el= library included in emacs. That file only names phases
to quarter moon precision, so I adapted it to split the lunar cycle into 8, not 4 (adding gibbous
and crescent moons (both waxing and waning)) to match the precision of the moon phase emojis.

* a note about macOS
Macs come bundled with a version of emacs that is _ancient_. Problem is, this script is only
compatible with emacs 24+ (I think: I wrote it using emacs 26). If you're on macOS and you don't
know what sort of emacs you have, crack open a shell and run ~emacs --version~, followed by ~brew
install emacs~ if needed.

* next steps
The problem with =lunar.el= in the first place (besides only quarter-moon precision, which isn't that
big of a deal) is that it's hardcoded to specific use cases with emacs' calendar and diary, and has
no general-purpose API. This is also the case with this repo at the moment. It wouldn't be that hard
to extract a general-purpose "get the moon phase and/or emoji for any arbitrary date" function from
the code in here: if that sounds fun, please do clone it down and open a PR!
